    "Many people argue against the implementation of public transportation in their neighborhoods, citing its tendency to bring crime into their communities. But is this really true? Much research has been done looking into the relationship between public transportation and crime rates and different conclusions have been drawn. Some claim that public transportation can “import” crime into wealthy neighborhoods, leading to higher than normal crime rates. Others see this crime “import” effect as unconvincing, and instead find public transportation alleviates socioeconomic stressors which provoke people into doing crime in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "An issue presented when studying public transportation, particularly discerning its impact on crime rates, is the seeming lack of A/B testing. A place that has access to public transportation and one that doesn’t cannot typically be tested against each other without accounting for a multitude of external factors. This makes sense because many things contribute to whether or not a place is given the opportunity to have public transportation or not. In a clever attempt to navigate this issue, David C. Phillips and Danielle Sandler<a name=\"cite_note-1\"></a> [^](#cite_ref-1) wrote a paper analyzing crime rates in the Washington D.C. area when certain transit stations were closed. The paper found that crime decreases across the railway network when stations are closed and that the decrease in crime was felt more in areas where fewer offenders lived. In essence, the closure of stations can inhibit how easily criminals can navigate the network.\n",

    "Another project, completed by Greg Ridgeway and John MacDonald, looked more holistically at the railway network in Los Angeles over a 27 year span from 1988-2014.<a name=\"cite_note-2\"></a> [^](#cite_ref-2) They conclude that there is little evidence that access to public railways lead to an increase in crime in neighborhoods. While they do concede that criminals could use railways to travel to lower crime, wealthy areas to find victims, they argue that access to public transportation could lower overall crime rates in a metropolitan area. They claim that giving public transit access to people who hail from low socioeconomic areas can help them seek better opportunities rather than resort to crime.\n",

    "Looking through the lens of public safety, Tanya Lewis writes an article detailing how public transportation results in far fewer deaths and fewer crimes than automobile travel. <a name=\"cite_note-3\"></a> [^](#cite_ref-3) Per 1 billion passenger miles traveled in 2022, automobiles caused 16.8 fatalities in rural areas and 11.5 in urban areas. To contrast, rail transit fatalities were 5.9 per 1 billion miles and many were non-occupant fatalities that resulted from suicide. Additionally, crimes like assault, robbery, and homicide are down on public transportation in 2023 compared to in 2019 while motor vehicle theft and road rage incidents involving guns are up. The article suggests that many people feel more unsafe on public transportation than they should according to the statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diving deeper into this phenomenon, Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris and Camille Fink address the fear women feel when using public transportation.<a name=\"cite_note-4\"></a> [^](#cite_ref-4) Women will often avoid certain railways, only use them in the day, or forego public transportation altogether due to fear of victimization. According to Loukaitou-Sideris and Fink, much of this blame should be put into the lack of input women get when designing safety procedures for public transportation. Citing the lack of security, cameras, panic buttons, or other bystanders who could help, the authors argue that women will continue to avoid public transportation so long as there is no greater attempt to prevent crime around transportation infrastructure like bus stops, trains etc. If public transportation does in fact have a way of bringing crime to certain areas, increased security around transit stops could potentially help to mitigate this.\n",
