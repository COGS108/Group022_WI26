    "We hypothesize that the relationship between San Diego Trolley ridership and nearby crime rates over time will be weak or mixed, rather than uniformly positive or negative. This is because we expect that any observed differences in crime patterns will be driven largely by preexisting neighborhood socioeconomic conditions, rather than the transit use itself. This aligns with prior research suggesting public transit is often blamed for crime patterns that reflect broader structural inequities rather than transit use.\n",

    "Our ideal dataset would be a relational database containing different entities on transit data for the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System (MTS) Trolley lines, crime reports in San Diego County, and socioeconomic surveys or census data for San Diegan neighborhoods, specifically along the trolley lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "This research question requires temporal data on transit operations and ridership to relate crime activity trends. Hence, we would want our “transit data” to contain daily data of service supply—the number of trains in operation, the hours they run, any schedule adjustments made, also security assignments to each station, and station-level ridership activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ridership activity goes hand in hand with the “socioeconomic and census data” listed above. To analyze the effects of the San Diego Trolley lines on crime across multiple locations, we would incorporate socioeconomic variables, like median household income, unemployment, or index of accessibility to radial highways or streets. Additionally, we consider rider information, including trip frequency, daily commute time, and transit dependency. This data may further our research to contextualize any relationship between crime rate and public transit by trolley. For example, we could explore trends in ridership demographics, allowing us to investigate if recent line expansions facilitate the movement of crime or if the infrastructure itself is a hotspot for criminal activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each station, we would need crime reports within a reasonable radius of each trolley station. We would especially need the time and location of the incident to estimate if crime may be related to the trolley system in any way. Ideally, these combinations of datasets—transit data, crime reports, census data—would provide sufficient information as to why the crime occurred near the station. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ideal dataset would have day-to-day granularity. We consider the number of MTS Trolley stations (62), the timeframe (3-5 years or 1096-1827 days), and the crime buffer to capture our necessary information. Ultimately, this database would consist of approximately 113,000 daily observations. This granularity would distinguish the impact of ridership crowding from typical crime rates and provide an adequate sample for testing causal interactions between transit flow and localized criminal activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset of daily transit data, yearly census data, and daily crime reports would be collected by MTS, the City or County of San Diego, the San Diego Association of Governments, and the San Diego Police Department (SDPD). The transit data is collected via contactless payment systems (PRONTO) and service supply from GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) feeds. The SDPD records all crime activity in its Automated Regional Justice Information System, accessed via the SANCGIS portal or Open San Diego data feeds. These data would be stored in a relational database, where transit data is identified by its stop ID, census data by neighborhood, and crime reports by incident ID or geospatial information, such as timestamp and street location. This data would be spatially joined using Geographic Information System (GIS) methods since we are interested in the location of crime relative to trolley stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest difference between this ideal dataset and actual data would be the temporal and socioeconomic resolution. Ideally, the dataset would contain daily, synchronized information on the immediate demographic profile of riders, transit schedules, and nearby crime rates. Instead, we have to use annual census and equity data as a proxy and stratify this information against the daily trolley and crime activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have several real datasets to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://data.sandiego.gov/datasets/transit-stops/ contains basic information on transit stops and stations in San Diego County. This will let us determine the distance radius from each trolley station for any crime incidents. We can use any of the geospatial variables such as `stop_uid` or `stop_id` to uniquely identify trolley stops and `stop_name` or `(stop_lon, stop_lat)` to filter crime incidents near these locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://www.sdmts.com/business-center/app-developers/real-time-data links to real time data for transit operations in San Diego. Accessing this data requires an API key, which can be requested by submitting personal information and reasons for access. The high-resolution variables such as `occupancy_status, timestamps, delays, arrivals, departures`, etc. are necessary for inferential analysis, allowing us to explore the impact of service-related crowding and standard criminal activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://www.sandiego.gov/police/data-transparency/crime-statistics/annual-crime-reports provides links to annual crimes by incident and by neighborhood and historical crime reports for San Diego, whereas https://www.crimemapping.com/map/location/San%20Diego,%20CA,%20USA is an interactive map for locating incidents of crime, arrests, and citations in San Diego County. Using these data together, we can extract exact coordinates or locations and timestamps of arrest and citations. This allows us to perform a spatial join with our trolley station and analyze transit services to these incidents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://data.sandiegocounty.gov/dataset/Equity-Report-Data-Demographics/q9ix-kfws/about_data, https://data.sandiegocounty.gov/dataset/Equity-Report-Data-Geography/p6uw-qxpv/about_data are equity reports in San Diego by demographics and geography, respectively. This data has information on commute times and methods of transportation of San Diegans and most notably `Median Amount of Debt`, `Disproportionality Index`, and methods of transportation `indicators`. These variables are necessary for contextualizing any findings about the relationship between crime rate and trolley services.\n",

    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [x] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example of how to use the checkbox, and also of how you can put in a short paragraph that discusses the way this checklist item affects your project.  Remove this paragraph and the X in the checkbox before you fill this out for your project\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "> Our project uses publicly available ridership and police-reported crime datasets, both of which are subject to systemic collection biases. Crime data reflected reported incidents rather than absolute true crime occurence and the accuracy of reports may vary across neighborhoods due to diffences in policing intensity, community trust in law enforcement and other factors. Ridership data may also overrepresent frequent riders rather than number of separate individuals. To address these concerns, we plan to be midful of these limitations when interpreting results, consider normalization of our data, and avoid drawing strong causal and opinionated conclussions from raw counts alone. \n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [x] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [x] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [x] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "> While our analysis is quantitative, we recognize that our project may imply a sentiment towards the transit system, local communities, commuters and neighborhoods. To reduce potential blindspots, we plan to incorporate a wide range of relevant datasets where available, such as ridership patterns, crime statistics, and neighborhood-level socioeconomic indicators. \n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "> We are aware that dataset bias may arise from uneven data coverage since some trolley stations are more recently built than others, imbalanced station activity levels, and other variables. To mitigate these issues, we plan to incorporate relevant variables, test altervative models, and examine whether results are sensitive to different assumptions. This allow us to better assess the persuasivenees of observed patterns and reduce the risk of misleading conclusions. \n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "> When presenting results, we aim to design visualizations that accurately and transparently our data and analysis. This includes using consistent axis scales across comparable plots, avoiding visual distortions that could create exaggerated or misleading trends. Clearly labeling units and time ranges is also important to keep authenticity. In addition, using different plots and graphs to represent complex patterns rather than descriptive statistics to avoid oversimplyfying is something we should consider as well. \n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "> To support the reproducibility and transparency of our project, we plan to document our data, analysis and models in every step in a clear and organized manner. Code and intermediate outputs will be well recorded to allow others to rretrace the analysis pipeline if needed. This can help us ensure that potential errors can be identified easily and results can be tested or extended in later stages of our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "> Our analysis may vary across neighborhoods with different socioeconomic characteristics, which could lead to misleading interpretations of results. We can examine results across different  subgroups. By comparing patterns across these groups, we can better understand whether observed relationships between ridership and crime differ systematically by context. This subgroup-based perspective helps us interpret findings more carefully and reduces the risk of drawing conclusions that may disproportionately reflect only certain groups.\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "> We are aware that the choice of evalustion metics can influence how results are interpreted. Rather than relying on a single measure, we plan to explore multiple complementary metrics, such as crime counts, normalized crime rates, ridership growth percentages, and other relevant statistics. Considering multiple perspectives allows for a more informed understanding of our research question. \n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "> To address this concers, we can prioritize interpretability when selecting analytical models and presenting results. Model outputs will be explained in understandable language and terms. This helps ensure that findings can be meaningfully interpreted by non-technical audiences and supports transparent communication of analytical outcomes.\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "> We will clearly commubicate the limitations of this study, including observational nature of the data, potential reporting biases, the presence of unmeasured confounding variables and that we cannot establish causal relationships in our project. For example, we acknowledge that reported crime rate does not equal absolute true crime occurence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [x] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [x] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary？\n",
    "> It is important to be able to revise or modify an analysis approach if issues are identifies. If problematic patterns, misleading results or unintended interpretations emerge during the project, we can adjust model specifications, go back and trace our documented analysis and codes to correct the errors or remove certain analysis from the final report. By doing that, we intend to prevent the presentation of results that may be inaccurate or potentially harmful.\n",
    " - [x] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    " - The findings from this project could be misinterpreted or used in unintended ways, such as reinforcing negative stereotypes about the transit system or certain neighborhoods. To reduce this risk, we plan to carefully frame results, avoid opinionated conclusions, and emphasize contextual factors and limitations. \n"
