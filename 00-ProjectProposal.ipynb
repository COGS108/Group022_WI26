    "### A. Data Collection\n",
    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our project uses publicly available ridership and police-reported crime datasets, both of which are subject to systemic collection biases. Crime data reflected reported incidents rather than absolute true crime occurence and the accuracy of reports may vary across neighborhoods due to diffences in policing intensity, community trust in law enforcement and other factors. Ridership data may also overrepresent frequent riders rather than number of separate individuals. To address these concerns, we plan to be midful of these limitations when interpreting results, consider normalization of our data, and avoid drawing strong causal and opinionated conclussions from raw counts alone.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> While our analysis is quantitative, we recognize that our project may imply a sentiment towards the transit system, local communities, commuters and neighborhoods. To reduce potential blindspots, we plan to incorporate a wide range of relevant datasets where available, such as ridership patterns, crime statistics, and neighborhood-level socioeconomic indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We are aware that dataset bias may arise from uneven data coverage since some trolley stations are more recently built than others, imbalanced station activity levels, and other variables. To mitigate these issues, we plan to incorporate relevant variables, test altervative models, and examine whether results are sensitive to different assumptions. This allow us to better assess the persuasivenees of observed patterns and reduce the risk of misleading conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> When presenting results, we aim to design visualizations that accurately and transparently our data and analysis. This includes using consistent axis scales across comparable plots, avoiding visual distortions that could create exaggerated or misleading trends. Clearly labeling units and time ranges is also important to keep authenticity. In addition, using different plots and graphs to represent complex patterns rather than descriptive statistics to avoid oversimplyfying is something we should consider as well.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> To support the reproducibility and transparency of our project, we plan to document our data, analysis and models in every step in a clear and organized manner. Code and intermediate outputs will be well recorded to allow others to rretrace the analysis pipeline if needed. This can help us ensure that potential errors can be identified easily and results can be tested or extended in later stages of our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Our analysis may vary across neighborhoods with different socioeconomic characteristics, which could lead to misleading interpretations of results. We can examine results across different  subgroups. By comparing patterns across these groups, we can better understand whether observed relationships between ridership and crime differ systematically by context. This subgroup-based perspective helps us interpret findings more carefully and reduces the risk of drawing conclusions that may disproportionately reflect only certain groups.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> We are aware that the choice of evalustion metics can influence how results are interpreted. Rather than relying on a single measure, we plan to explore multiple complementary metrics, such as crime counts, normalized crime rates, ridership growth percentages, and other relevant statistics. Considering multiple perspectives allows for a more informed understanding of our research question.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> To address this concers, we can prioritize interpretability when selecting analytical models and presenting results. Model outputs will be explained in understandable language and terms. This helps ensure that findings can be meaningfully interpreted by non-technical audiences and supports transparent communication of analytical outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> We will clearly commubicate the limitations of this study, including observational nature of the data, potential reporting biases, the presence of unmeasured confounding variables and that we cannot establish causal relationships in our project. For example, we acknowledge that reported crime rate does not equal absolute true crime occurence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary？\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is important to be able to revise or modify an analysis approach if issues are identifies. If problematic patterns, misleading results or unintended interpretations emerge during the project, we can adjust model specifications, go back and trace our documented analysis and codes to correct the errors or remove certain analysis from the final report. By doing that, we intend to prevent the presentation of results that may be inaccurate or potentially harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The findings from this project could be misinterpreted or used in unintended ways, such as reinforcing negative stereotypes about the transit system or certain neighborhoods. To reduce this risk, we plan to carefully frame results, avoid opinionated conclusions, and emphasize contextual factors and limitations. \n"
